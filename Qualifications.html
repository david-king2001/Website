    <a href="Resume.pdf">Experience</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Over the past years, I have amassed a great level of job experience both in entry-level and more experienced positions. I started like most high schoolers did, working at a local fast-food restaurant. I spent the latter half of my senior year of high school working until I left for college. After beginning my college career, I was offered a position working for an Accounting company on the technical side of the business. I was able to work from home, completing various reports and creating spreadsheets for use with clients and internal tracking. The summer before my Sophomore year, I received a paid internship offer to work for <a href="https://www.afcec.af.mil/">AFCEC/CZCA</a>, a civil engineering division within the Air force.
      <br>
      I worked with a small team based at Lackland AFB. At the time, the pandemic had just begun and we were forced to work in a purely virtual capacity. My role was to provide support in a general capacity. I worked on a range of projects such as; preparing leadership briefing, data analysis, and review of various contracts and/or technical documents. This position served to provide an introduction to the formal workplace, providing experience I plan to use in the future.

  <p>
    As Computer Engineering major at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>, I have gained a considerable amount of knowledge from the various course I have taken. I have acquired many important skills such as; Data Structures, Computer Architecture and design, Computer Systems, and more. In addition, I have learned various languages such as Java, Python, C++, and HTML. As progress in my degree, my list of skills will only improve.

  </h2>
    <p>
    I choose the major of Computer Engineering partly to be able to work in many different areas. The field I find particularly fascinating is robotics. I feel this industry has an unlimited amount of possibilities. The field of robotics can be applied to just about anywhere. I wish to contribute and push the limits of what robotics can do.
