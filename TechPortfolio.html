    <p>
      During my senior year of high school, I lead a small team to compete in a local First Robotics competition.  This competition focused on designing and building a robot that was capable for retrieving various items, usually small cubes or balls.  For this competition, I designed, modeled, and 3-D printed an apparatus that utilized rubber bands to trap the objects.  However, the prototype did not work, since the material used in the 3-D printed model was too weak.  After extensive problem solving, we determined that wood would be an appropriate material.  During the competition, we were able to pick up the more objects than any other team.  This ensured that we placed 3rd in our area.

    <h2><a href="images/walkaround.mp4">Mustang Project</a></h2>
    <p>
      In my Freshman year of college, my father and I wanted a challenging project that we could work on together.  After searching for several months, I found a 1968 Ford Mustang coupe that would require work on everything from the body to the engine and other mechanical aspects. We found the car, purchased it, and flat bedded it to our home.  Since that time, we have been slowly working on restoring this treasure, learning about wiring, engines, transmissions, and body work as we go.  Everything we have compelted on this project has been done by hand in our 2-car garage.
